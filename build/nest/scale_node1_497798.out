Nov 03 16:43:25 SimulationManager::run [Warning]: 
    The requested simulation time is not an integer multiple of the minimal 
    delay in the network. This may result in inconsistent results under the 
    following conditions: (i) A network contains more than one source of 
    randomness, e.g., two different poisson_generators, and (ii) Simulate is 
    called repeatedly with simulation times that are not multiples of the 
    minimal delay.

    Simulaton time (ms): 250
    Number of OpenMP threads: 144
