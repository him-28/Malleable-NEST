Name: MoveFile - Rename a file

Synopsis:

string1 string2 MoveFile -> boolean


Examples:

(Simulation1) (obsolete) MoveFile -> The File Simulation1 
is now called obsolete


Description:

Rename a file, e.g. link the file to the new name 
and unlink the old filename. If this unlink was the only link 
to the file, the old file is effectively deleted. 
Note that this is only guaranteed to work if new and old filename 
refer to the same directory. Renaming over different directories 
might work, but that's not POSIX and thus not portable.


Parameters:

string1 : Old File 
string2 : NewFile 
boolean : A flag if operation succeded.


Bugs:

-


Remarks:

Since POSIX rename() did not work for some obscur reasons, 
MoveFile indeed works by linking the new filename and unlinking 
the old one! 
But that's exactly what rename() is supposed to do, no damage done...
