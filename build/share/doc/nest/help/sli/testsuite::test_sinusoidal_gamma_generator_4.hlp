Name: testsuite::test_sinusoidal_gamma_generator_4 - Test parallel generation of sinusoidally modulate Gammaian trains with individual spike trains

Synopsis:

nest_indirect test_sinusoidal_gamma_generator_4.sli ->	-


Description:

Creates a sinusoidally modulated Gamma generator emitting 
individual spike trains to each of its targets and sends spikes to 
spike detector. Identical to ..._2, but with single generator, not one per VP.
