Name: testsuite::test_multimeter_stepping - test if multimeter returns same values for stepped simulation

Synopsis:

(test_multimeter_stepping.sli) run -> dies if assertion fails


Description:

The script checks all models providing a "recordables" entry in their 
status dict.  It creates a multimeter, sets it to record from all 
recordables. The neuron receives Poisson input. This is done once for 
a single 50 x MinDelay simulation and once for 50 subsequent MinDelay simulations. The test passes 
if both cases produce identical results.
