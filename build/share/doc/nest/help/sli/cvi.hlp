Name: cvi - Convert double/string to integer

Synopsis:

double cvi -> integer 
string cvi -> integer


Examples:

3.33 cvi	 --> 3 
2   cvi	 --> 2 
(23) cvi	 --> 23 
(23.2323) cvi --> 23 
(hello) cvi   --> 0


Description:

integer is the number without digits after decimal point (the same 
result as floor), if it is executed with a
