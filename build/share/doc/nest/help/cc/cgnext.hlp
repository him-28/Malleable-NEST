Name: cgnext - Call next() on a ConnectionGenerator

Synopsis:

cg cgnext -> source target v[0] ... true | false


Description:

Call the next() function on a given ConnectionGenerator cg 
to iterate cg's connections on the SLI level. This function 
will return the source and the target of the connection, a 
list containing the values for the connection (if there are 
any), and true, or false, if cg cannot be iterated further.


Parameters:

cg	- ConnectionGenerator


Remarks:

This function is part of the low-level access API for the 
ConnectionGenerator module. It is mainly used for debugging 
purposes. Usually, connections are created from a 
ConnectionGenerator using CGConnect.
